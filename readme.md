# Awesome Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re/)

> A curated list of resources for optimizing content visibility in AI-powered search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Claude, etc.)

**Also known as**: AI Search Optimization (AISO), Answer Engine Optimization (AEO), Large Language Model Optimization (LLMO), Generative AI Optimization, AI SEO, LLM SEO

## What is GEO?

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the practice of optimizing content to improve visibility and citations in AI-powered search engines. Unlike traditional SEO which focuses on ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs), GEO aims to have content referenced, cited, and recommended by Large Language Models (LLMs) when they generate responses.

### Why GEO Matters

- **AI search is growing rapidly** - ChatGPT commands ~4.33% of search traffic, with 300% growth in unique domains receiving AI traffic in 2024 ([SEMrush study](https://www.semrush.com/blog/chatgpt-search-insights/))
- **New user behaviors** - Users write 23-word prompts to ChatGPT (vs 4.2 words in traditional search), seeking comprehensive answers rather than links ([SEMrush analysis](https://www.semrush.com/blog/chatgpt-search-insights/))
- **Direct answers, not blue links** - AI engines provide synthesized information directly, making citation inclusion critical for visibility
- **Multiple platforms** - Beyond Google, users now search via ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini,  Perplexity, and other AI assistants

### Key GEO Concepts

- **Citations and Attribution** - Getting brands and content cited as sources in AI-generated responses
- **Entity Optimization** - Strengthening brand presence as a recognized entity across the web
- **E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)** - Quality signals that influence AI recommendations. While E-E-A-T matters for traditional SEO, it's even more critical for GEO because LLMs prioritize citing authoritative sources to maintain accuracy. AI engines theoretically look for clear author credentials, publication dates, citations to primary sources, and corroboration across multiple trusted sites when selecting which content to reference in their responses
- **llms.txt** - A proposed standard file (like robots.txt) for communicating with LLM crawlers. While not yet universally adopted, companies like Stripe, Zapier, and Cloudflare have implemented it
- **Multi-platform Optimization** - Optimizing for different AI engines' unique algorithms and citation styles

### GEO vs Traditional SEO

While GEO shares foundations with SEO (quality content, technical optimization, authority building), it differs in key ways:

- **Optimization target** - LLM training data and retrieval systems vs. traditional search algorithms
- **Success metrics** - Citation frequency and brand mentions vs. rankings and clicks
- **Content strategy** - Comprehensive, authoritative information vs. keyword-targeted pages
- **Technical requirements** - Structured data for LLM comprehension vs. crawlability alone
